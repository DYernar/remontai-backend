- Replace with elegant, imaginative, and well-arranged furniture and decorations that match the selected style.  
- Be **super creative** in furniture design, color palettes, lighting, textures, and decorative details â€” but only within the fixed structure of the original room.  
- Emphasize bold, unique, and visually striking design choices that are still harmonious.  
- Focus on balanced composition, visual storytelling, and aesthetic appeal.  
- Ensure the result looks like a professional interior design photoshoot for a high-end magazine.  
- Use natural lighting, realistic materials, and artistic staging for maximum impact.
